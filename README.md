### Context
I am a huge football fan and football statistics fascinate me. This data helps you to understand who is really who in the world of football. After discovering the understat.com platform with extended analytics about every single game in top European leagues I started to understand football even more. So I decided to take a look at some numbers of all teams of all leagues that not many people go for.

### Content

### Acknowledgements
Huge thanks for the team of [understat.com](https://understat.com/) for collecting this data and make it open to the world.

### Inspiration
With this dataset we can have more arguments in describing every league and can find answers to questions like:

Which teams create more chances to score a goal?

Which teams use pressure a lot and what results does this give?

Which teams play more defensive/offensive football?

Which teams have luck on their side, which do not?

Is there any particular characteristic of each league?

With this high overview dataset we can play a lot and understand more European football.
